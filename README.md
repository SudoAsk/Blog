This is the Ghost company blog theme which runs on blog.ghost.org and dev.ghost.org. It's not intended for distribution as an easily re-usable theme, but it is provided here as open source for anybody to hack on and work with if they'd like to.

# Development

Compile Sass from the root dir of the theme

```
sass --watch assets/sass/screen.scss:assets/css/screen.css --style compressed
```
